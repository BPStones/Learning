# Learning
## Overview

This repository has been set up so I can teach myself Github. It is an ongoing project, so it will be at different stages of development depending upon when you visit. 

## Objective

Having worked across regulatory environments (such as Finance and Aerospace), I believe I have a lot of skill to bring to software organisations. As such, my objective is to upskill and move across into the SaaS Industry. For this, I know I need to learn eDocs-as-Code, (I call it eDocs-as-code because then it becomes a palindrome and that sort of thing pleases me!), GIT (and GITHUB), OpenAPI/Swagger, and Markdown/Confluence. I will submit my notes regarding each through documents I'll store on GITHUB.
